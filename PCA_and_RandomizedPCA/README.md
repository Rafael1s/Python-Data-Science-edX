## PCA notebook with Interactive 3D and 2D images

A note to the notebook PCA_Armadillo 3D.ipynb. To get the interactive 3D and 2D 
images of Armadilio add the %matplotlib notebook. Then, by moving the mouse over 
the image you will get coodinates (x, y, z) for the case __Armadillo 3D__, 
and (x, y) for 2D projections (blue and red) of Armadillo.
